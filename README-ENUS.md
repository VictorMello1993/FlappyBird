<h2>:triangular_flag_on_post: Getting started</h2>
The app is very simple, as it runs 100% in the browser, no back-end. To run it, just follow the step by step:

1- Make sure you have installed the <strong>Live Server</strong> extension on VS Code. If not, go to the VS Code package manager to search for it and install, as shown in the image below:

2- In ```flappy.html```, press F1 button to run the command <strong>Live Server: Open with Live Server</strong> which will open a browser window automatically. The interesting thing about this extension is that once you apply the command, after any change in your code, it's not necessary to apply it again. Just save the file with CTRL+S shortcut that the browser renders and it's refreshed automatically.

3- That's it, the app is already running! Enjoy yourself! =)
